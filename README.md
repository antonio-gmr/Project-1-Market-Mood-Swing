MARKET MOOD SWING is a web app that gives the users the ability to view the market mood and putting aside traditional researching strategies. As a user I want to find specific financial news about a company of my interest easy to find and in a single website and get to know the market’s mood so i can make quick decisions on my investment.

## Prerequisites
You don't need to install software, only get access to internet and paste the deployed link.

## Instalation
Don't needed

## Summary
What motivated us to develop the app is the vast number of people that don’t have access to robust analysis programs and have to rely on news sources, the problem with that is that there is no way you can read everything that comes out about a certain company to decide if you’ll invest. So, we decided to add an specific space for the user to read comments writed for a professional and help him to analize if he wants to invest or not in that company (not all companies have this feature); at the same time the user can see the company's mood in that specific moment.

## Features

- Easy access to the app, just click on the link. 
- Clean interface, it doesn't need an instructive to use it.
- Simplified UI design that helps the user to navigate among 20 important companies in the world.
- One click over your favorite company and you'll be able to get the most recent news about its market mood.
- No adds added to use it.
